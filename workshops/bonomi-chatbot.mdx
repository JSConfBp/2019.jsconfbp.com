In this workshop, you will be assisted to create a Node application using Typescript and Express. It will connect to the Messenger Platform and respond to anyone who sends a message to a particular Facebook Page. With Wit.ai integration, it will be able to recognise user intents and entities and look up data from a local database to decide what to do with it.

The workshop starts with a quick introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Artificial Intelligence and a guide on how to create an application on top of the Messenger Platform. Therefore, no prior knowledge in these areas are required, only a keen interest in AI and chatbots.

By the end of the workshop, everyone will have a working Messenger account that can be interacted with either by sending messages or clicking on buttons. It will be able to respond to small talk, recognise a couple of user intents, tell jokes or even the current weather forecast. This application will then be launched using free Heroku components or run locally with the help of Ngrok.

Requirements:
- Javascript knowledge
- Github account
- VS Code or other editor installed
- Nodejs and NPM installed

Extras:
- Heroku account
- Ngrok installed
- Wit.ai account
