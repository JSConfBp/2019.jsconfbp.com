Service-oriented architecture and microservices have fundamentally changed the way we design
and develop our applications. It’s up to us to adapt to this change and enrich our developer toolkit
with one new addition: GraphQL.

There are many GraphQL usable libraries, but there’s one which enables outstanding quality and performance: Apollo.

The attendees of this workshop are going to become more familiar with Apollo, both on the client
and server side, and will learn how to implement both sides of a GraphQL server.
