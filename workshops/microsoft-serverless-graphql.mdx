The attendees will learn how to:
- Build a GraphQL API and in doing so they learn the fundamentals of creating a schema, define resolvers and query said API.
- Create microservices and Dockerize them ( some fundamentals of Docker will be taught ), this will explain the concepts of a Microservice and how you can prepare this for the Cloud through Dockerizing it. It also makes it consumable for a GraphQL API, which we will show
- Host the API in a Serverless function and deploy the same, this will teach some fundamentals in Serverless function creation, debugging and deployment

Prerequirements for this workshop:

- Node.js,
- Docker and
- VS Code installed ( we will give out specific instructions to make Serverless work on VS Code )
