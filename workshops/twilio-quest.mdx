The day starts with a static HTML site with little functionality. Step by step we will improve the site, making it more interactive, and add different communication features to it. The site will quickly be able to send WhatsApp messages to your friends and display any received photos. It will include real-time communication features such as chat and video to help you keep in touch with your visitors. And, of course, weâ€™ll learn a little bit about AI and serverless, too!

In this workshop, you will learn what is needed to change communication with your friends, family and the whole world by writing a few lines of JavaScript and calling a few APIs.
