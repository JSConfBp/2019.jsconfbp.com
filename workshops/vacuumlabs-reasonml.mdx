Reason lets you write simple, fast, type-safe code while leveraging both the JavaScript & OCaml ecosystems. If these are the qualities
that you appreciate come to this workshop powered by Vacuumlabs to play with Reason. We will build a real-world app using Reason language
with the help of React and GraphQL. Basic knowledge of JavaScript, React and GraphQL is an advantage but not necessary.
