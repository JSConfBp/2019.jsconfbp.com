Raise your hands if you all start to panic when you mess up your local git workflow, trying frantically
to save your work and eventually giving in to the complications thereby deleting your repository.
Well, Git isn’t the terrible dinosaur you think it is, on the contrary, the messier it becomes,
the more interesting it gets. This session aims to make friends with Git and to express the hidden gems
in the mysterious git land which will definitely help you to become more productive and look cool in front
of your peers struggling with a git-gone-wild.
