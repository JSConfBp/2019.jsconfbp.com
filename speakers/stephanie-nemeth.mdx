I’m introvert. This can be bit unfortunate, when you are a person that enjoys spending a lot of their free time
creating things bedazzled with LEDs… only to rarely wear them out in public. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In an effort to actually share my weird and wonderful creations with others, I decided create a wearable project
that would force me to be sociable in order for it to reveal its magic. In this talk, I’ll share how I used machine
learning with javascript and tiny computers to make “fashion” that is responsive to the people around you and the
attention you are (or aren’t) receiving.
