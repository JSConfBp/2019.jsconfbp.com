Did you ever feel like monkey patching your UI component? Adding too many if/else, handling a lot of complexity
or hacking several non-desired side effects.
Did you ever have a problem with double-clicking an async button? Fetching multiple times the same resource in a row?
Did you have problems translating UX interfaces and mock-ups into your applications scenes?

All this kind of problems can be properly fixed by applying a different point of view. An architecture based upon
Mealy state machines. Also known as finite state machines or automatas. These machines are deterministic, pure and
idempotents. Opening a new set of possibilities from predictable components to autogenerated tests.

Let's take a look to this new paradigm for UI components.
You'll discover a better and cleaner world ;)
