Flat, muted minimalism, vast fields of whitespace, millennial pink landing pages, and those corporate illustrations that
all kind of look the same: the internet today, amirite? In the West, consumers and web developers have deep-rooted
expectations of how the web should work and look that have gone largely unquestioned.

In this talk, we'll take stock of these biases and take a culturally relativistic look at the internet outside of
our comfort zone. We'll explore questions like: Why are Japanese websites so information-dense? How does a script
like Arabic, read right to left, affect web design? What languages do (or can) programmers across the world use?
Attendees of this talk will walk away with  a fresh perspective and ideas for improving our web and making technology
that's more inclusive of a global audience.
