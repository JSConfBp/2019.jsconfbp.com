Debugging JavaScript can drive developers crazy. It’s not surprising when so many us stick to the trusty
console.log - but there are better ways. From tracking down a critical issue in production, to simply
struggling to add a new feature and not realising you’ve misread some documentation - debugging skills
are used every day but it's difficult to take the time to improve those skills when the pressure is on.
This talk will show you some really handy techniques that will level up your skills of deductive reasoning.
