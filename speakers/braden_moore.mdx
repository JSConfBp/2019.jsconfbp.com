Early last year, my colleagues and I did something amazing — using only JavaScript, the browser, and the Web Audio API,
we were able to decipher brainwaves. It sounds sensational, but it’s (mostly) true. This is a story about how we converted
brainwaves into audio signals — and then back again — to solve the problem of epilepsy diagnosis on the web.

In this talk, you’ll get to see a new browser API being used in a novel and unprecedented way, combined with world-leading
innovations in the field of epilepsy diagnosis. You’ll learn about the challenges of real-time brainwave filtering and how
we solved them. As you’ll see, the technologies we use each day can sometimes be applied in unexpected ways. And sometimes,
they make a huge difference in the lives of others.

Come along for the journey as we decipher brainwaves in the browser.
