In 1985 pop music was mesmerized by the a-ha “Take on me” music video. It’s been almost 35 years since then,
the world needs new catchy tunes with impressive video animations… on the web.

In this talk we will explore the bewitching ways we can modify web videos and create immersive experiences
worthy of the ‘80s using JavaScript and CSS. Let us swim in the why-not possibility of Chroma key, Rotoscoping
and more video animation techniques on the web platform!
