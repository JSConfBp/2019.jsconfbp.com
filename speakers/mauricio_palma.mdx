Unfortunately, we still treat accessibility in the same way we deal with front-end development for older browsers,
something to be done at the end. What if I tell you that we can use the latest Web APIs and still offer an inclusive
and accessible experience.

In this talk, you'll learn how to combine Web APIs such as Speech Recognition and Geolocation, with performant
Javascript techniques to create empathic user interfaces.
