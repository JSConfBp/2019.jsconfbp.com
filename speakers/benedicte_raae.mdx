Do I want to track my cycles? Yes.
Do I want the tracker to push my data to a third party? Hell NO!
Do I want the data lying around unencrypted in a database somewhere? Not really.
Do I want backup and access from multiple devices? Kinda..
What would I need to learn and is it even possible? Come along on my journey, as a run of the mill web developer,
to create a secure and private web-based period tracker.
